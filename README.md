# webscraping-project
This project uses the web-scraping concept of python to fetch data from website and store it in a file. A beginner can confidently go for this project.
This projects basic idea is to ask user to enter the skills that they are good at, and hence fetching jobs for them  in the site. Here I choose the Times Jobs site.

the libraries we need to import are beautifulsoup, requests.
beautifulsoup: this  library is used to parse the html,xml documents. 
requests: to request and get the http link.

Features:
1.User Input: Users can input their skills to filter job listings.
2.Web Scraping: Utilizes BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to scrape job listings from TimesJobs.
3.Filtering: Filters job listings based on user-defined skills.
4.File Saving: Saves relevant job listings to text files for future reference.
5.Periodic Updates: Periodically checks for new job listings every specified interval.

Usage:

The script will filter and save relevant job listings automatically.
